```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download("openbmb/VoxCPM1.5")
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The interface will launch at `http://127.0.0.1:7860` (or another available port).

### Interface Tabs

#### 🎵 Tab 1: Basic Generation

Simple text-to-speech synthesis with minimal configuration.

**Steps:**
1. Enter your text in the text box
2. Enable/disable text normalization:
   - **ON**: For regular text with numbers and punctuation
   - **OFF**: For phoneme input with precise pronunciation control
3. Click "Generate Speech"

**Example:**
```
Text: "VoxCPM is an innovative end-to-end TTS model from ModelBest."
Text Normalization: OFF (for phoneme input) or ON (for regular text)
```

#### 🎤 Tab 2: Voice Cloning

Clone any voice using a reference audio sample.

**Steps:**
1. Enter the text you want to synthesize
2. Upload a reference audio file (the voice you want to clone)
3. Optionally provide the transcript of the reference audio
4. Configure enhancement:
   - **Enable**: Clean voice at 16kHz (recommended for noisy audio)
   - **Disable**: High-quality cloning up to 44.1kHz
5. Click "Clone Voice"

**Tips:**
- Use clear, high-quality reference audio for best results
- Provide the transcript for improved accuracy
- Reference audio should be 3-10 seconds long

#### ⚙️ Tab 3: Advanced Settings

Fine-tune all generation parameters for optimal results.

**Generation Parameters:**

- **CFG Value** (0.5-5.0, default: 2.0)
  - Higher values: Better adherence to prompt, may sound strained
  - Lower values: More relaxed, natural speech
  - Recommended: 2.5-3.5 for short sentences, 1.5-2.0 for long texts

- **Inference Timesteps** (5-50, default: 10)
  - Higher values: Better quality, slower generation
  - Lower values: Faster generation, draft quality
  - Recommended: 5-10 for drafts, 20-50 for high quality

- **Text Normalization**
  - Enable for regular text with numbers and abbreviations
  - Disable for phoneme input

- **Denoise Output**
  - Enable for cleaner audio (limits to 16kHz, may cause distortion)
  - Disable for natural output

- **Prompt Speech Enhancement**
  - Enable for clean voice cloning (16kHz limit)
  - Disable for high-quality cloning (up to 44.1kHz)

**Retry Settings:**

- **Enable Retry for Bad Cases**: Automatically retry if generation is unstable
- **Maximum Retry Times** (1-10, default: 3): Number of retry attempts
- **Retry Ratio Threshold** (3.0-10.0, default: 6.0): Length restriction for bad case detection

**Generation Modes:**
- **Generate**: Standard generation mode
- **Generate (Streaming)**: Real-time streaming generation for faster processing

## 👩‍🍳 Quick Tips

### Text Input
- **Regular Text**: Keep "Text Normalization" ON for natural text with numbers and punctuation
- **Phoneme Input**: Turn "Text Normalization" OFF for precise pronunciation control

### Voice Cloning
- **Clean Voice Cloning**: Enable "Prompt Speech Enhancement" (16kHz limit)
- **High-Quality Cloning**: Disable enhancement for up to 44.1kHz sampling
- Use clear, noise-free reference audio for best results

### Quality vs Speed
- **Short Sentences**: Increase CFG value (2.5-3.5) for better clarity
- **Long Texts**: Lower CFG value (1.5-2.0) for better stability
- **Fast Draft**: Use lower inference timesteps (5-10)
- **High Quality**: Use higher inference timesteps (20-50)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Model Information
- **Model**: VoxCPM1.5
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz
- **Token Rate**: 6.25Hz
- **Architecture**: Tokenizer-free TTS
- **Languages**: Chinese and English

### Windows Compatibility
The application includes special handling for Windows systems:
- Disables `torch.compile` to avoid Dynamo errors
- Uses `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0` for server binding
- Automatically suppresses PyTorch compilation warnings

### API Access
The application exposes a REST API for programmatic access. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:7860/docs` when the app is running to see the API documentation.

## 📊 Performance

- **RTF (Real-Time Factor)**: 0.17 on RTX 4090
- **Streaming Mode**: Faster processing with chunked generation
- **Memory Usage**: Varies based on text length and settings

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Output quality depends on prompt speech quality
- Model is trained on Chinese and English data
- Please use responsibly and mark AI-generated content appropriately
- For research and development purposes only
- The model may not perform well on languages other than Chinese and English

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues
If automatic download fails:
```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download("openbmb/VoxCPM1.5", cache_dir="./models")
```

### GPU Memory Issues
If you encounter out-of-memory errors:
- Reduce inference timesteps
- Process shorter text segments
- Use CPU mode (slower but works)

### Audio Quality Issues
- Ensure reference audio is clear and high-quality
- Try adjusting CFG value
- Increase inference timesteps
- Disable denoise if output sounds distorted

### Windows-Specific Issues
The application automatically handles Windows compatibility issues. If you still encounter problems:
- Ensure PyTorch is properly installed
- Check that CUDA is available (for GPU acceleration)
- Try running with CPU mode if GPU issues persist
